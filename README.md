## General Info
This e-commerce web application is designed to allow visitors to browse a list of products, add a quantity of them to their cart, and check out their items converting the cart into an order associated with their account. I created this project to learn and show my level of understanding of backend technologies like the Django framework, MVT design pattern and database management, and frontend technologies like Javascript, Ajax and Bootstrap.

## Technologies
* Python 3.10.7
* Django 4.2.1
* JavaScript
* jQuery 3.7.1
* Bootstrap v5
* SQLite 3.41.2
